# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`car_prices_prediction.ipynb`) that focuses on predicting car prices using various machine learning regression models. The project explores different data encoding techniques, evaluates model performance using key metrics, and identifies significant features influencing car prices.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The notebook covers:
* Data loading, exploration, and preprocessing.
* Implementation and comparison of Random Forest Regression models using both Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
* Analysis of feature importance to understand key drivers of car prices.
* Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as R2, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MedAE.
* Insights into model strengths and areas for potential improvement, particularly regarding predictions for high-value vehicles.

## ðŸ’¾ Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle:
* **Vehicle Sales Data:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data/data?select=car_prices.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data/data?select=car_prices.csv)
